# PWA Text Editor

## Description

This app was an excercise in configuring and utilizing webpack, along with building service workers and deploying an application on the Render platform.  Most of the code was pre-built, I just needed to tie everything together.  As it stands, this application does configure a webpack but I have not properly implemented the correct outputs through the installation, so the javascript files for downloading the text editor for offline use do not allow the button to work.  I will return to this project further down the line to implement this.
